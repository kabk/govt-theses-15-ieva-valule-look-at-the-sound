              <div class="fr-text">Recently I had a fruitful and trilling collaborating with an alumna student from Royal Conservatory The Hague [3] . First Nerea Vera [4] approached me and proposed me to introduce graphic design in one of her percussion concerts by Iannis Xenakis [5] &nbsp;- Psappha [6]. After the first meeting, she made it clear - that a majority of concerts have a dull atmosphere. She believed that some visuals really could make a change and lighten up the space. We agreed to create visual piece that would represent her music style and characteristics of Iannis Xenakis composition. As a result, I created an animation that was built the way as this piece was composed. Music visualizations were inspired by the dynamic rhythm, mathematical composition structure and muscularity of the piece. (Figure 1)</div>

              <div class="fr-text">I did enjoy this “cross field" working method. However I believe that one discipline can learn from the other a lot. It is possible to have surprising results by learning principles from other fields and applying them in the field of graphic design. In fact, I believe that my mission as a graphic designer is to help my clients to stand out and to be seen.
                <br>
                <br>Siamak Anvari approached me with his request and interest in collaboration with me. His request was similar as I described before in the case of Nerea. Siamak is an alumnus of the master program of "Sonology department" of the Royal Conservatory The Hague. Also he faces the same struggle as Nerea. It is hard to attract visitors and fill up the audience since the dull atmosphere of thse events.
