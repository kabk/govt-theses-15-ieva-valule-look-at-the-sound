    <strong>How does image work as an agent of meaning in a performance of music?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The purpose of this research is to analyze and explore a meaningful ways of images complimenting sound. In fact I have been considering collaboration with
    a Sonology Master postgraduate who as a matter of fact confronted me with his struggle to attract and expand his audience.
</p>
<p>
    In order to find a way to visualize any sounds I am doing a study on intuitive reactions and co-operation of the senses while listening to the music or
    sounds. Furthermore I am analyzing how audiovisual art disciplines as abstract film, computer graphics and graphic sound progressed through out the time.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to this I have been researching neurological phenomenon of Chromesthesia.
</p>
<p>
    The anticipated outcome of this research is to explore ways of visualizing music in graphical way that is based on scientific theories and yet remains to
    be emotional.

    <strong>Introduction</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This report examines beneficial ways of visualizing sound performance from graphic designer and sonologist point of view. Based on my research of
</p>
<p>
    a historical narrative of audio visual arts and phenomenon of Chromosthesia –
</p>
<p>
    I am trying to find a way that we actually can look at the sound during the performance.
</p>
<p>
    I strongly believe that we should cherish the emotional on symbolic connection between the music and visual arts. But even so there is a hypothesis about
    something more than just an abstract connection between our senses of hearing and seeing. Eventually I came across actual "wonder"
</p>
<p>
    in which heard sounds automatically and involuntary evoke an experience of
</p>
<p>
    a color. However, until relatively recently, little had been written on this form of synesthesia<em>*. </em>A particular problem area of my research
    question is to analyze already exciting forms of audiovisual arts. Overall there are endless possibilities to visualize sound or music. In this report you
    will find examples that are explicitly related to field of the sonology or graphic design.
</p>
<p>
    Based on available literature research, interviews and experiment this report will examine possibilities how does image works as an agent of meaning in
    musical performance.

    <strong>Previous experience with visualizing music was a trigger to start this research.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Recently I had a fruitful and trilling collaborating with a alumna student from Royal Conservatory The Hague. First Nerea Vera approached me and proposed
    me to introduce some graphic design in one of her percussion pieces by Iannis Xenakis - Psappha. After the first meeting she made it clear - that a
    majority of concerts of well-known pieces have really dull atmosphere. She believed that graphic design or some visuals really could make a change and
    lighten up the space. We agreed to create visual piece that would represent her music style and characteristics of Iannis Xenakis composition. As a final
    result I created an animation that was built the way as this peace was composed. My visualizations were inspired by dynamic rhythm, mathematical
    composition structure and muscularity of the piece.
</p>
<p>
    I did enjoy this cross "field" working method. However I believe that one discipline can learn from the other a lot. It is possible to have surprising
    results by learning principles from other fields and applying them in territories that concerns my field of expertise. As a matter of fact I believe that
    my mission as graphic designer is to help my clients to stand out and be seen. And there is no other discipline that deserves this more than musicians and
    composers.
</p>
<p>
    Siamak Anvari approached me with his request and interest in collaboration with me. His request was similar as I described before in case of Nerea.
</p>
<p>
    Siamak is alumni of master program of "Sinology department" of Royal Conservatory The Hague. Also he faces the same struggle as Nerea. It is hard to
    attract visitors and fill up the audience since the dull atmosphere of events. It really lacks some other dimension and added value.

</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    People who are musically trained listens to music vary different way than non-trained listeners. They tend to turn their attention more on textures and
    melody before other aspects of musical piece. Since I am not musically trained and have no special talents regarding the field of music; I have to keep in
    mind that I do approach compositions different way than musically trained person.
</p>
<p>
    Due that my research does not go in to the depth of the professional music listening or production.
</p>
<p>
    However good hearing does not necessarily insure skilled listening, conversely, poor hearing does not indicate an inability to listen to music. It is
    something to keep in mind before approaching any auditory. Musical visualization can support ability to listen music by evoking sound trough a sight.
    Nevertheless there are also shortcomings of multi - sensory method of listening to music, though that was discussed with music professionals. As an example
    it is possible that visuals can change a meaning of musical peace and distract listeners attention from musical piece.

    <strong>Methodology</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Using our senses simultaneously</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Synesthesia – an actual sensation of seeing sound.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Synesthesia is a harmless condition that allows a person to appreciate sounds, colors or words with two or more senses simultaneously. People who report
    this kind of experiences are known as syntesthetes. It is an involuntary ability to hear colors, see music or even taste each word. Neurologically it is
    condition of accidental cross wiring in the brain that is found in 1 of 2000 people. Synesthesia has been proven to be more common in women and left-handed
    individuals. There is also a significant tendency for synaesthetes to spend more time engaged in creative arts. For example, synaesthetes experiencing
    vision from music are far more likely to play an instrument.

    />
    However skeptics have dismissed synesthesia as nothing more then a subjective invention. For a long time drugs or overly active imagination was to be
    blamed for synesthesia as well a trick of memory or past associations. But recently some neuroscientists has been able to prove that synaesthetes do have a
    sensation of seeing sound. A series of brain scans showed "visual activity" in the brain of experiment participants even thought they were blindfolded.

    <strong>Chromesthesia</strong>
</p>
<p>
    These are just a few hypotheses that could genuinely take music beyond its current form. Synesthesia is a very interesting phenomenon with chromesthesia
    being one of its most interesting form. For one some sound can evoke sensation of seeing colors. Some individuals can see music on a "screen" in front of
    their eyes. For others certain sounds can induce sensations in parts of body. The color associations, that is, which color is associated to which sound,
    tone, pitch, or timbre is highly peculiar, but in most cases, consistent over time.
</p>
<p>
    Researchers have concluded that chromesthesia affects nearly all of us. For instance lower pitch notes more relate to darker colors (dark brown and dark
    purple), but higher pitch notes more to the lighter colors - bright yellow and white. There is a trend that people tend to choose darker colors for lower
    pitch noises rather then light colors and all the way around. That means that we all have mechanisms inside us that links music to image.
</p>
<p>
    Secondly there are even more obvious evidences of synesthesia - when sound is described by visual and physical measures, hence low notes and high notes.
    For instance in Bali and Java: pitches are not low and high but large and small. This is a very natural attribution, which can be found in our everyday
    experience. For example, we never expect a low sound projecting from a very small object or the other way around. <sup>1</sup>
</p>
<p>
    The perception of rhythm involves the whole organism, it requires five fundamental capacities: time, sense of intensity, auditory imagery, motor imagery
    and motor impulse. Motor impulse is instinctive and said to be unconscious like ability of chromesthesia (Seashore, c. The sense of rhythm as musical
    talent 1981)
</p>
<p>
    Even different tempos can cause sensation of chromesthesia. Emily Freeman (2003) did a study on audience using the pieces of music played in three
    different tempos. The study showed that tempo significantly affects the color associations made while listening to the same piece of music on different
    tempos. Nevertheless musical sounds also include two other components:
</p>
<p>
    the pitch (it is oftenly characterized as "weight" of the sound) and its timbre. Metaphores are frequently used to describe pitch or timbre. The word
    Bright is used to describe the quality of sound, therefore it is implying that these musical components has a color content that is used in musical
    practice.
</p>
<p>
    One research that I came across by Paul A. Haac (1981) (Haack, P. A. R., R.E (1981) A case study of a chromesthetic. Jornal of Research in Music Education
    29(2). 85-90) suggested that the following pitch-color relationships are experienced consistently in A Major:
</p>
<p>
    A: Lavender
</p>
<p>
    B: Orange
</p>
<p>
    C♯: Red
</p>
<p>
    D: Blue
</p>
<p>
    E: Green
</p>
<p>
    F♯: Brown
</p>
<p>
    G♯: Black
</p>
<p>
    Above all Black key low pitches were reported to elicit greater color intensity.
</p>
<p>
    Other well-studied case involved an art teacher who had a range of consistent linkages between tone and color. For her, high octaves tended to evoke a
    lighter color value, while lower octaves evoked a darker color value. And rapid major chord tone sequences elicited rapid flashes of colors, "somewhat like
    fireworks exploding

    <strong>Synesthetic experience</strong>
    <strong> in art.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    We see the 'synesthetic experience' particularly in all forms of art like: poetry, painting, sculpture and music. Synesthesia makes a link from one sensory
    domain to another; likewise we assume that creativity is an ability to make unique connections between different concerns and ideas.
</p>
<p>
    "Synesthesia is seven times more common among artists, novelists and poets, and creative people in general," says neuroscientist Dr. Ramachandran, "artists
    often have the ability to link unconnected domains, have the power of metaphor and the capability of blending realities,"

        The old dream of the artist to let all senses melt into a total synesthetic experience can also be found in the spectacular and the ever-present
        electronic media. As a consequence of the new interactive media (the explosion of information and knowledge), our consciousness, senses and body will
        emerge into new experiences with unlimited synesthetical qualities: Tele-synesthesia — instant, global and multi-sensory. The content of a medium is
        the preceding medium, wrote Marshall McLuhan. An inevitable consequence of this rule is that one who strives for a deeper content always lands up at
        the previous medium:

    Synesthesia played a big role in the futurist art, Dadaist and surrealist creative practice. Nowadays synesthesia is an important component in
    computer-generated art forms. After these considerations, we may confirm that 'synesthesia' has always been an underlying basic principle in the aesthetic
    experience of the arts. Without a synesthesia in the world, there would be no art.
    <br/>
    <br/>
</p>
<p>
    Music is a special symbiotic model of art; all the components of piece are gathered in one container ­­­— musical piece. Music allows expressing personal
    emotions, sensations and feelings in one unifying media of sound. So music already by its essence is something so close to concept of synesthetic
    sensation.

    <em>Wassily Kandinsky, 'Concerning the Spiritual in Art (New York: Dover Publications) 1986.</em>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Wassily Wassilyevich Kandinsky was an influential Russian painter and art theorist. He is often credited for creating first truly abstract paintings. While
    writing that "music is the ultimate teacher” Kandinsky believed that he could possibly evoke sound through sight and create a painting that would
    equivalent to a symphonic music. This art would stimulate not just the viewers eyes but also ears. For this artist music and color were tightly tied
    together.
</p>
<p>
    Music played an important role in Kandinsky’s abstract paintings and life. The famous Viennese composer Arnold Schönberg was a big influence in his works.
    Schönberg abandoned tonal and harmonic conventions in his compositions the same way that Kandinsky rejected the figure or recognizable object in favor of
    shapes, lines, and clashing colors in his work. He used color, line, shape, and texture to create a rhythmic visual experience that evoked an emotional
    response. Kandinsky could see colors when he heard music, and hear music when he painted. He once described his discovery of synesthesia that occurred
    during an opera performance in Moscow:
</p>
<p>
    <em></em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>I saw all my colors in spirit, before my eyes. Wild, almost crazy lines were sketched in front of me.</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em></em>
</p>
<p>
    Wassily heard his paint box hissing while mixing different colors of paint. Here Wassily Kandinsky describes his favorite color:
</p>
<p>
    <em>“</em>
    <em>
        The deeper the blue becomes, the more strongly it calls man towards the infinite, awakening in him a desire for the pure and, finally, for the
        supernatural… The brighter it becomes, the more it loses its sound, until it turns into silent stillness and becomes white."
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    <em></em>
</p>
<p>
    It’s clear that this man saw more in color than the non-synesthetes and even synesthetes .To him, color was more than a quality of an object, or adjective.
    He thought colors had its own meaning, its own depth, its own purpose and texture.

    <strong>Visual Rhythms of Piet Mondrian</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Mondrian's spirituality and love for the music profoundly influenced his work and, ultimately, the art world by that time. Mondrian's paintings have a lot
    of different mediums of inspirations — starting from the subway map of the city till music and dance moves of boogie-woogie. It is possible to sense
pulsing and lively rhythm of music. His latest paintings are an allegory of colorful music ­— dynamic lines, contrasts and optical vibrations.    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Sounds of Rothko</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Rothko's color fields are an innovation to enter artist’s approach of a spiritual feeling or infinity. Color fields in the paintings should be transmitted
    in to spiritual energy and emotions, hence causing synesthetic experiences. Colors can seem to be moving back and forth as if it would be a life organism.
    Some critics have referred that his paintings aspire music, suspending sound in the color. Rothko himself believed that his work cause emotions of tragedy,
    euphoria and sublime. Rothko's paintings are metaphors of colors created to stimulate our consciousness.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The “ticket</strong>
    <strong>”</strong>
    <strong>to the </strong>
    <strong>meaningful image </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Synesthesia can help to understand the mind of an artist. Synesthesia and metaphor also is another proof of link between creativity and this neurological
    phenomenon. Indeed art is an extension of the function of the brains. As an illustration in the modern art perception precedes meaning, and medium precedes
    message, but our synestetic abilities help us to find that meaning with ease. Artist gives us a "ticket" to experience reality of artist’s routine or
    statement. This "ticket" gives us shared synestetic experiences, because the power of meaningful art is to extend our horizon of perception.

    <strong>Narrative of Audiovisual Art </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Graphic Sound</strong>
</p>
<p>
    It is probably the most direct way of translating images to sound. The images serve as mechanical instrument of sound. For the first time graphic sound
could be heard using sound-in-film method. Sound-on-film refers to a film print where the sound accompanying picture is physically in to filmstrip.    <em>(Photo).</em> Sound track was a mechanical reproduction of gramophone-like grooves along the filmstrip.
    <br/>
    <br/>
</p>
<p>
    First who had an idea to translate visually meaningful image in sound was animator Mikhail Tsekhanovsky. By seeing image of signal, he thought of replacing
    optical sound waves to visually meaning ornaments. “What if we take some Egyptian or ancient Greek ornaments as a sound track, perhaps we will hear some
    unknown archaic music?” said Mikhail Tsekhanovsky. His followers soon become pioneers of this genre with ideas of “ornamental”, "drawn," “paper”,
    “graphical”, “artificial” or "synthetic" sound. It was a possibility to produce music without performer, We could assume it is starting point of creating
    electronic music as we practice it nowadays.
</p>
<p>
    Even though this kind way of creating music or visuals is not directly connected to performance, it is a subject worth to study to broaden my expertise of
    systems to translate images in to music.
</p>
<strong>

</strong>
<p>
    <strong>Shaping the sound</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Oscar Wilhem Fischinger was an abstract animator, filmmaker and painter. He is notable for creating first abstract musical animations many decades before
    computers graphics or term "music video" was invented. In this chapter I will elaborate more on Fishinger's graphic sound experiments. He was one of the
    pioneers of creating sound from shapes, lines, and colors. In the 30s he started to experiment producing sound by drawing abstract and repetitive patterns
    on the film’s optical track. In his opinion this was the way to have a perfect control and synergy between sound and image. These films were without any
    narrative or construction. His aim was trigger emotional experiences and synesthetic sensations in the viewer.
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        "Between ornament and music persist direct connections, which means that Ornaments are Music. If you look at a strip of film from my experiments with
        synthetic sound, you will see along one edge a thin stripe of jagged ornamental patterns. These ornaments are drawn music -- they are sound: when run
        through a projector, these graphic sounds broadcast tones or a hitherto unheard of purity, and thus, quite obviously, fantastic possibilities open up
        for the composition of music in the future. Undoubtedly, the composer of tomorrow will no longer write mere notes, which the composer himself can never
        realize definitively, but which rather must languish, abandoned to various capricious reproducers."

    "I draw a lot of little lines on the sound track area of the 35mm film. Maybe 50 or 60 lines for every musical note. The number of strokes to the inch
    controls the pitch of the note: the more, the higher the pitch; the fewer, the lower the pitch, the size of the stroke controls the loudness...the tone
    quality is the most difficult element to control, it is made by the shape of the strokes. Well rounded forms gives smooth sounds; sharper or angular forms
    give harder and harsher sounds. By drawing or exposing two or more patterns on the same bit of film I can create harmony and textual effects."

    "An Instrument For Sonification of Everyday Things” is one of the recent artworks/music instruments in field of Graphic Sound. Instrument rotates everyday
    things, scans their surfaces and transforms them into audio. Actually any everyday object in certain weight and size amplitude can be implemented in
    musical instrument; in fact their silhouettes will create loops, melodies and even rhythms. Experience of playing the instrument depends on specific
    object's surface structure, construction and characteristics of shape.

    <strong>for music performance visualizing</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Initially color organs was a mechanical device ,that was built already in 18th century to represent sound in a visual medium. Of corse nowadays this medium
    remains to be electromechanical.
</p>
<p>
    Quest of creating color organs have challenged many people already before first abstract filmmakers such as Oskar Fishinger, Len lye and Norman McLAren.
    The basic idea about so called "color organs" is to display colored light in fluid and liquid way so it would synchronize with the music.
</p>
<p>
    The first theories about this kind of accompaniment to music derived already in ancient greece. Aristotle believed that there must be a correlation between
    the musical scale and rainbow spectrum, like there would be an analogy to the number of notes in a musical scale and number of colors in rainbow. A lot of
    inventors and artists later on was fascinated by this idea. Later on also Leonardo Da Vinci produced light shows for court festivals based on this theory
    of Aristotle.
</p>
<p>
    How ever I came across one particularly interesting example of "light show" accompanied by music. It was created by Father Lous Bertrand Castel. "Ocular
    Harpsichord" was an realization of an idea of an imagined instrument. It consisted from 2m<sup>2</sup> square frame that was placed on top of a normal
    Harpsichord ( string instrument similar to pianos. The main difference that can be seen between the piano and harpsichord is in the use of their strings.
    While hammers are used to strike the strings of the piano, the strings are plucked in a harpsichord.) The frame consisted of 60 small different color
    windows. Each of theses windows were attaches by string to one specific key, so that each time someone would struck particular key curtain would lift
    briefly to show a flash of colored light.

    This instrument was groundbreaking — society was absolutely dazzeld. Later on also improved model was released. It was upgraded with 500 candles with
    reflecting mirrors to provide enough light for a larger audience. It is interesting to compare our electronic advantages with that time practical
    solutions. We clearly can imagine that is was rather hard to control this instrument that could easily crate a fire hazard. We also have to keep in mind
    that most likely it was awkward and noisy, since the use of robes and little curtains. Also 500 hundred candles produced a lot of heat. Nevertheless, the
    factor a clumsy technology was something that inventor couldn't overcome or improve. Even though Castel predicted that every home in Paris would own an
    Ocular Harpsichord; when in fact no physical and original machines have survived till nowadays.

    Despite technical limitations, many others experimented with clumsy machinery, including ones using colored liquids and daylight filtered through colored
    glass in a darkened tent. The Victorian era "philosophical toys" also had their color-music versions, including "chromatrope" slides for Magic Lanterns, in
    which layers of colored glass could be rotated by a hand-crank to produce moving mandalas, as well as abstract cycles for Zoetropes, Phenakisticopes and
    Praxinoscopes

    Anyway inventors and artist were restless to do more experiments with this particular model. It was improved by colored liquids, light filters, different
    tints of colored glass etc. Also "Victorian Era" came with their unique tools to illustrate music like chronotope slides, zoetropes with abstract drawings
    and early animation devices like phenakistoscopes and praxinoscopes.

    It seems to be that only sustainable tools to accompany music performance were invented by the time of innovation of electricity. This innovation open new
    possibilities of using projection lights and moving lights. One of the pioneers of of electromechanical color organ shows was A. Wallace Rimington in 1915.
    In one of his shows he wanted that everyone in the audience wears a white clothing, so the projected colors would be reflected on their bodies and the
    whole room.

    In 1920's world really experienced revival of color organs. By that time a group of theosophists wanted to build a color organ to demonstrate spiritual
    experiences. It was called the art of color-music projections - Lumia. It was fluid streams of lights slowly metamorphosing. One of the groups members
    -Thomas Wilfred built "lumia boxes" that would look like a TV sets. They could play for days or months without repaying the same imagery motion. Trend of
    "Lumia" was prom net art activity. By that time even a special institute of "Art of Light" was establishes in New York.
