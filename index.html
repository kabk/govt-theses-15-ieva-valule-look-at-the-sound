<b><p>How does image work as an agent of meaning in a performance of music?</p></b>

<p>The purpose of this research is to analyze and explore a meaningful ways of images complimenting sound. In fact, I have been considering collaboration with a Sonology Master postgraduate who in fact confronted me with his struggle to attract and expand his audience. </p>

<p>In order to find a way to visualize any sounds I am doing a study on intuitive reactions and co-operation of the senses while listening to the music or sounds. Furthermore, I am analyzing how audiovisual art disciplines as abstract film; computer graphics and graphic sound progressed through out the time. In addition to this, I have been researching neurological phenomenon of Chromesthesia. </p>

<p>The anticipated outcome of this research is to explore ways of visualizing music in graphical way that is based on scientific theories and yet remains to be emotional. </p>

<br />
<p>Introduction</p>

<p>This report examines beneficial ways of visualizing sound performance from graphic designer and sonologist<href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> point of view. Based on my research of a historical narrative of audiovisual arts and phenomenon of Chromosthesia – I am trying to find a way that we actually can look at the sound during the performance. </p>

<p>I strongly believe that we should cherish the emotional on symbolic connection between the music and visual arts. Even so there is a hypothesis about something more than just an abstract connection between our senses of hearing and seeing. Eventually I came across actual "wonder" in which heard sounds automatically and involuntary evoke an experience of a color. However, until relatively recently, little had been written on this form of synesthesia<href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>. A particular problem area of my research question is to analyze already exciting forms of audiovisual arts. Overall there are endless possibilities to visualize sound or music. In this report, you will find examples that are explicitly related to field of the sonology or graphic design. </p>

<p>Based on available literature research, interviews and experiment this report will examine possibilities how does image works as an agent of meaning in musical performance. </p>

<br />
<p>Previous experience with visualizing music was a trigger to start this research.</p>

<p>Recently I had a fruitful and trilling collaborating with a alumna student from Royal Conservatory The Hague. First Nerea Vera approached me and proposed me to introduce some graphic design in one of her percussion pieces by Iannis Xenakis<href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> - Psappha<href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a>. After the first meeting, she made it clear - that a majority of concerts of well-known pieces have dull atmosphere. She believed that graphic design or some visuals really could make a change and lighten up the space. We agreed to create visual piece that would represent her music style and characteristics of Iannis Xenakis composition. As a result, I created an animation that was built the way as this peace was composed. My visualizations are inspired by dynamic rhythm, mathematical composition structure and muscularity of the piece. (Photo 1.1)</p>

<p>I did enjoy this cross "field" working method. However I believe that one discipline can learn from the other a lot. It is possible to have surprising results by learning principles from other fields and applying them in territories that concerns my field of expertise. In fact, I believe that my mission as graphic designer is to help my clients to stand out and to be seen. Moreover, there is no other discipline that deserves this more than musicians and composers. </p>

<p>Siamak Anvari approached me with his request and interest in collaboration with me. His request was similar as I described before in case of Nerea. Siamak is alumni of master program of "Sinology department" of Royal Conservatory The Hague. Also he faces the same struggle as Nerea. It is hard to attract visitors and fill up the audience since the dull atmosphere of events. It really lacks some other dimension and benefit. <b><sub></sub></b></p>

<p>Premise</p>

<p>People who are musically trained listens to music vary different way than non-trained listeners. They tend to turn their attention more on textures and melody before other aspects of musical piece. Since I am not musically trained and have no special talents regarding the field of music; I have to keep in mind that I do approach compositions different way than musically trained person. Due that, my research does not go in to the depth of the professional music listening or production.</p>

<p>However good hearing does not necessarily insure skilled listening, conversely, poor hearing does not indicate an inability to listen to music. It is something to keep in mind before approaching any auditory. Musical visualization can support ability to listen music by evoking sound trough a sight. Nevertheless, there are also shortcomings of multi - sensory method of listening to music, though that was discussed with music professionals. As an example, it is possible that visuals can change a meaning of musical peace and distract listeners’ attention from musical piece. </p>

<p>1. Using our senses simultaneously</p>

<p>1.1 Synesthesia is an actual sensation of seeing sound.</p>

<p>Synesthesia is a harmless condition that allows a person to appreciate sounds, colors or words with two or more senses simultaneously. People who report this kind of experiences are known as syntesthetes. It is an involuntary ability to hear colors, see music or even taste each word. Neurologically it is condition of accidental cross wiring in the brain that is found in 1 of 2000 people. Synesthesia has been proven more common in women and left-handed individuals. There is also a significant tendency for synaesthetes to spend more time engaged in creative arts. For example, synaesthetes experiencing vision from music are far more likely to play an instrument. However, skeptics have dismissed synesthesia as nothing more then a subjective invention. For a long time drugs or overly active imagination was to be blamed for synesthesia as well a trick of memory or past associations. Recently some neuroscientists has been able to prove that synaesthetes do have a sensation of seeing sound. A series of brain scans showed "visual activity" in the brain of experiment participants even thought they were blindfolded. (Photo 1.1.1)</p>

<p>2. Chromesthesia</p>

<p>These are just a few hypotheses that could genuinely take music beyond its current form. Synesthesia is a very interesting phenomenon with chromesthesia being one of its most interesting forms. For one some sound can evoke sensation of seeing colors. Some individuals can see music on a "screen" in front of their eyes. For others certain sounds can induce sensations in parts of body. The color associations, that is, which color is associated to which sound, tone, pitch, or timbre is highly peculiar, but in most cases, consistent over time.</p>

<p>Researchers have concluded that chromesthesia affects nearly all of us. For instance lower pitch notes more relate to darker colors (dark brown and dark purple), but higher pitch notes more to the lighter colors - bright yellow and white. There is a trend that people tend to choose darker colors for lower pitch noises rather then light colors and all the way around. That means that we all have mechanisms inside us that links music to image. </p>

<p>Secondly there are even more obvious evidences of synesthesia - when sound is described by visual and physical measures, hence low notes and high notes. </p>

<p>For instance in Bali and Java: pitches are not low and high but large and small. This is a very natural attribution, which can be found in our everyday experience. For example, we never expect a low sound projecting from a very small object or the other way around. <href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a></p>

<p>“The perception of rhythm involves the whole organism, it requires five fundamental capacities: time, sense of intensity, auditory imagery, motor imagery and motor impulse. Motor impulse is instinctive and said to be unconscious like ability of chromesthesia. <href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">[7]</a></p>

<p>Even different tempos can cause sensation of chromesthesia. Emily Freeman in 2003 did a study on audience using the pieces of music played in three different tempos. The study showed that tempo significantly affects the color associations made while listening to the same piece of music on different tempos.<href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="">[8]</a> Nevertheless musical sounds also include two other components: the pitch (it is often characterized as "weight" of the sound) and its timbre. Metaphors are frequently used to describe pitch or timbre. The word Bright is used to describe the quality of sound, therefore it is implying that these musical components has a color content that is used in musical practice. </p>

<p>Research that I came across by Paul A. Haack in 1981 was a case study of a chromesthetic phenomena that is involving following pitch-color relationships that are experienced consistently in A Major:</p>

<p>Other well-studied case by Dr. Haack involved an art teacher who had a range of consistent linkages between tone and color. For her, high octaves tended to evoke a lighter color value, while lower octaves evoked a darker color value. And rapid major chord tone sequences elicited rapid flashes of colors, "somewhat like fireworks exploding”. <href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="">[9]</a></p>

<br />
<p>Synesthesia in art and music</p>

<p><b>3.1 Synesthetic experience in art.</b></p>

<p>We see the 'synesthetic experience' particularly in all forms of art like: poetry, painting, sculpture and music. Synesthesia makes a link from one sensory domain to another; likewise we assume that creativity is an ability to make unique connections between different concerns and ideas. </p>

<p>"Synesthesia is seven times more common among artists, novelists and poets, and creative people in general," says neuroscientist Dr. Ramachandran, "artists often have the ability to link unconnected domains, have the power of metaphor and the capability of blending realities,"<href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="">[10]</a></p>

<p><b>3.2 The content of a medium is the preceding medium</b></p>

<p>The old dream of the artist to let all senses melt into a total synesthetic experience can also be found in the spectacular and the ever-present electronic media. As a consequence of the new interactive media (the explosion of information and knowledge), our consciousness, senses and body will emerge into new experiences with unlimited synesthetical qualities: Tele-synesthesia — instant, global and multi-sensory. The content of a medium is the preceding medium, wrote Marshall McLuhan. An inevitable consequence of this rule is that one who strives for a deeper content always lands up at the previous medium:</p>

<p>The content of a medium is the preceding medium</p>

<p>For writing this is the voice</p>

<p>For photography this is painting and graphics</p>

<p>For film this is photography and the theatre</p>

<p>For radio this is the narrative and the concert</p>

<p>For interactive multimedia it is the opera and the gesamtkunstwerk<href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title="">[11]</a></p>

<p>Synesthesia played a big role in the futurist art, Dadaist and surrealist creative practice (Photo 3.2.1). Nowadays synesthesia is an important component in computer-generated art forms (Photo 3.2.2). After these considerations, we may confirm that 'synesthesia' has always been an underlying basic principle in the aesthetic experience of the arts. Without a synesthesia in the world, there would be no art. <br />
<br />
</p>

<p><br />
Music is a special symbiotic model of art; all the components of piece are gathered in one container ­­­— musical piece. Music allows expressing personal emotions, sensations and feelings in one unifying media of sound. So music already by its essence is something really close to concept of synesthetic sensation. </p>

<p><b>3.3 “The man who heard his paint box hiss.”</b></p>

<p><i>"Colour is the keyboard. The eye is the hammer. The soul is the piano with its many strings."<href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><b>[12]</b></a></i></p>

<p>Wassily Wassilyevich Kandinsky was an influential Russian painter and art theorist. He is often credited for creating first truly abstract paintings. While writing that "music is the ultimate teacher” Kandinsky believed that he could possibly evoke sound through sight and create a painting that would equivalent to a symphonic music. This art would stimulate not just the viewer’s eyes but also ears. For this artist music and color were tightly tied together. Music played an important role in Kandinsky’s abstract paintings and life. The famous Viennese composer Arnold Schönberg was a big influence in his works. Schönberg abandoned tonal and harmonic conventions in his compositions the same way that Kandinsky rejected the figure or recognizable object in favor of shapes, lines, and clashing colors in his work. He used color, line, shape, and texture to create a rhythmic visual experience that evoked an emotional response. Kandinsky could see colors when he heard music, and hear music when he painted. He once described his discovery of synesthesia that occurred during an opera performance in Moscow:</p>

<p><i>“I saw all my colors in spirit, before my eyes. Wild, almost crazy lines were sketched in front of me.”<href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><b>[13]</b></a></i></p>

<p>Wassily heard his paint box hissing while mixing different colors of paint. Here Wassily Kandinsky describes his favorite color (Photo 3.3.1) : </p>

<p>“The deeper the blue becomes, the more strongly it calls man towards the infinite, awakening in him a desire for the pure and, finally, for the supernatural… The brighter it becomes, the more it loses its sound, until it turns into silent stillness and becomes white."<href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title="">[14]</a></p>

<p>It’s clear that this man saw more in color than the non-synesthetes and even synesthetes .To him, color was more than a quality of an object, or adjective. He thought colors had its own meaning, its own depth, its own purpose and texture. <br />

<p><b>3.4 Visual Rhythms of Piet Mondrian</b></p>

<p>Mondrian's spirituality and love for the music profoundly influenced his work and, ultimately, the art world by that time. Mondrian's paintings have a lot of different mediums of inspirations — starting from the subway map of the city till music and dance moves of boogie-woogie. It is possible to sense pulsing and lively rhythm of music. His latest paintings (Photo 3.4.1) are an allegory of colorful music ­— dynamic lines, contrasts and optical vibrations. </p>

</b></p>

<p>Mondrian was fascinated by American jazz, particularly boogie-woogie. In his painting he was looking syncopated beat, irreverent approach to melody, and improvisational aesthetic. You can sense stuttering chromatic pulses, interrupted by light gray, create paths across the canvas suggesting the city's grid, the movement of traffic, and blinking electric lights, as well as the rhythms of jazz. <href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title="">[15]</a><br />

</b><p>3.5 Sounds of Rothko</p>

<p>Rothko's color fields are an innovation to enter artist’s approach of a spiritual feeling or infinity. Color fields in the paintings should be transmitted in to spiritual energy and emotions, hence causing synesthetic experiences. Colors can seem to be moving back and forth as if it would be a life organism. Some critics have referred that his paintings aspire music, suspending sound in the color. Rothko himself believed that his work cause emotions of tragedy, euphoria and sublime. Rothko's paintings are metaphors of colors created to stimulate our consciousness. (Photo 3.5.1)</p>

<p><b>3.5.1 Sandra Lousada - Mark Rothko at Whitechapel Gallery, 1961</b></p>

<p>Sandra Lousada claimed that Mark Rothko's work “affected the way I see for the rest of my life.”</p>

<b><br />
</b><p>3.6 The “ticket” to the meaningful image </p>

<p>Synesthesia can help to understand the mind of an artist. Synesthesia and metaphor also is another proof of link between creativity and this neurological phenomenon. Indeed art is an extension of the function of the brains. As an illustration in the modern art perception precedes meaning, and medium precedes message, but our synestetic abilities help us to find that meaning with ease. Artist gives us a "ticket" to experience reality of artist’s routine or statement. This "ticket" gives us shared synestetic experiences, because the power of meaningful art is to extend our horizon of perception.</p>

<p><b>Narrative of Audiovisual Art </b></p>

<p>4. Graphic Sound</p>

<p>It is probably the most direct way of translating images to sound. The images serve as mechanical instrument of sound. For the first time graphic sound could be heard using sound-in-film method. Sound-on-film (Photo 4) refers to a film print where the sound accompanying picture is physically in to filmstrip. Sound track was a mechanical reproduction of gramophone-like grooves along the filmstrip. <br />
<br />
</p>

<p>First who had an idea to translate visually meaningful image in sound was animator Mikhail Tsekhanovsky. By seeing image of signal, he thought of replacing optical sound waves to visually meaning ornaments. “What if we take some Egyptian or ancient Greek ornaments as a sound track, perhaps we will hear some unknown archaic music?” said Mikhail Tsekhanovsky. His followers soon become pioneers of this genre with ideas of “ornamental”, "drawn," “paper”, “graphical”, “artificial” or "synthetic" sound. It was a possibility to produce music without performer; we could assume it is starting point of creating electronic music as we practice it nowadays. </p>

<p>Even though this kind way of creating music or visuals is not directly connected to performance, it is a subject worth to study to broaden my expertise of systems to translate images in to music. </p>

<p>4.2 Shaping the sound</p>

<p>Oscar Wilhem Fischinger was an abstract animator, filmmaker and painter. He is notable for creating first abstract musical animations many decades before computers graphics or term "music video" was invented. In this chapter I will elaborate more on Fishinger's graphic sound experiments (Photo 4.2.1). He was one of the pioneers of creating sound from shapes, lines, and colors. In the 30s he started to experiment producing sound by drawing abstract and repetitive patterns on the film’s optical track. In his opinion this was the way to have a perfect control and synergy between sound and image. These films were without any narrative or construction. His aim was trigger emotional experiences and synesthetic sensations in the viewer (Photo 4.2.2). </p>

<p>Between ornament and music persist direct connections, which means that Ornaments are Music. If you look at a strip of film from my experiments with synthetic sound, you will see along one edge a thin stripe of jagged ornamental patterns. These ornaments are drawn music – they are sound: when run through a projector, these graphic sounds broadcast tones or a hitherto unheard of purity, and thus, quite obviously, fantastic possibilities open up for the composition of music in the future. Undoubtedly, the composer of tomorrow will no longer write mere notes, which the composer himself can never realize definitively, but which rather must languish, abandoned to various capricious reproducers.<href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title="">[16]</a></p>

<p>"I draw a lot of little lines on the sound track area of the 35mm film. Maybe 50 or 60 lines for every musical note. The number of strokes to the inch controls the pitch of the note: the more, the higher the pitch; the fewer, the lower the pitch, the size of the stroke controls the loudness...the tone quality is the most difficult element to control, it is made by the shape of the strokes. Well rounded forms gives smooth sounds; sharper or angular forms give harder and harsher sounds. By drawing or exposing two or more patterns on the same bit of film I can create harmony and textual effects." <href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title="">[18]</a></p>

<p>Norman Mclaren was also part of the pioneers that explored the field of graphic sound. He's expertise was to create sound strip that would create a sound with a film and generate a sound in the real time. He was also keener to synchronize not only rhythms and motion of shapes or colors, but also rhythms and melody of the final sound product.</p>

Instrument rotates everyday things, scans their surfaces and transforms them into audio. Actually, any everyday object in certain weight and size amplitude can be implemented in musical instrument; in fact, their silhouettes will create loops, melodies and even rhythms. Experience of playing the instrument depends on specific object's surface structure, construction and characteristics of shape. </p>

5. “Instruments” for music performance visualizing</p>

<p>Initially color organ was a mechanical device or “music” instrument, which was built already in 18th century to represent sound in a visual medium during a concert. Nowadays this medium remains to be electromechanical. </p>

<p>Quest of creating color organs have challenged many people already before first abstract filmmakers such as Oskar Fishinger, Len lye and Norman McLAren. The basic idea about so called "color organs" is to display colored light in fluid and liquid way so it would synchronize with the music. </p>

<p>The first theories about colorful light accompaniment to music derived already in ancient Greece. Aristotle believed that there must be a correlation between the musical scale and rainbow spectrum, like there would be an analogy to the number of notes in a musical scale and number of colors in rainbow. A lot of inventors and artists later on were fascinated by this idea. Thereafter also Leonardo Da Vinci produced light shows for court festivals based on this theory of Aristotle. </p>

<p><b>5.1 Ocular Harpsichord</b></p>

<p>How ever I came across one particularly interesting example of "light show" accompanied by music. Father Lous Bertrand Castel created it. "Ocular Harpsichord" was a realization of an idea of an imagined instrument. It consisted from 2m<sup>2</sup> square frame that was placed on top of a normal Harpsichord (string instrument similar to pianos. The main difference that can be seen between the piano and harpsichord is in the use of their strings. While hammers are used to strike the strings of the piano, the strings are plucked in a harpsichord.) The frame consisted of 60 small different color windows. Each of theses windows were attaches by string to one specific key, so that each time someone would struck particular key - curtain would lift briefly to show a flash of colored light. (Photo 5.1.1)<br />
<br />
This instrument was groundbreaking — society was absolutely dazzled. Later on also improved model was released. It was upgraded with 500 candles with reflecting mirrors to provide enough light for a larger audience. It is interesting to compare our electronic advantages with that time practical solutions. We clearly can imagine that is was rather hard to control this instrument that could easily crate a fire hazard. We also have to keep in mind that most likely it was awkward and noisy, since the use of robes and little curtains. Also 500 hundred candles produced a lot of heat. Nevertheless, the factor a clumsy technology was something that inventor couldn't overcome or improve. Even though Castel predicted that every home in Paris would own an Ocular Harpsichord; when in fact no physical and original machines have survived till nowadays. </p>

<p>Despite technical limitations, many others experimented with clumsy machinery, including ones using colored liquids and daylight filtered through colored glass in a darkened tent. </p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p><br />
<b>5.5.1 Charles Germain de Saint Aubin - A caricature of Louis-Bertrand Castel's "ocular organ". </b></p>

<br />
<p><b>5.2 Tireless Inventions</b></p>

<p>Anyway inventors and artist were restless to do more experiments with this particular model. Colored liquids, light filters, different tints of colored glass etc., were meant to improve it. Also "Victorian Era" came with their unique tools to illustrate music like chronotope (Photo 5.2.1) slides, zoetropes (Photo 5.2.2) with abstract drawings and early animation devices like phenakistoscopes (Photo 5.2.3) and praxinoscopes (Photo 5.2.4). </p>

<p>It seems to be that only sustainable tools to accompany music performance were invented by the time of innovation of electricity. This innovation opens new possibilities of using projection lights and moving lights. One of the pioneers of electromechanical color organ shows was A. Wallace Rimington in 1915. In one of his shows he wanted that everyone in the audience wears white clothing, so the projected colors would be reflected on their bodies and the whole room. In 1920's world really experienced revival of color organs. By that time a group of theosophists wanted to build a color organ to demonstrate spiritual experiences. It was called the art of color-music projections - Lumia. It was fluid streams of lights slowly metamorphosing. One of the group’s member -Thomas Wilfred built "lumia boxes" (Photo 5.2.4 and 5.2.5). That would look like a TV sets. They could play for days or months without repaying the same imagery motion. Trend of "Lumia" was prom net art activity. By that time even a special institute of "Art of Light" was establishes in New York.</p>

<p>Some group of people involved in revival of "color organs" in 30's and 40's. Charles Dockum begins building - Dockum's MobilColor Projectors (Photo 5.2.6). It was rather large and clumsy device that could produce crisp or soft imagery from prepared images. In 1935 he began the first experiments toward the development of Light Projection as a fine artist he was combing a knowledge of music and the graphic arts with his previous training in electrical and illumination engineering. There are not so much evidences of this device left but in materials that are present it is possible to see that it really did perform complex layered imagery (Photo 5.2.7). Dockum spent most of his life improving the first model of MobilColor and composing about 15 minutes of material that is possible still to perform. This composition shows three diverse types of imagery - geometric shapes, vibrating patterns and soft lines. </p>

<p>Another great device for music visualization is "Lumigraph"- Motion painting panels (Photo 5.3.1). In the late 40's it was patented by Oscar Fishinger. (More extensive description on his artistic ideas can be found in the chapter "Shaping the Sound".) Like any other inventors who have been busy with concept of "color organs", also Fishinger hoped that "Lumigraph" could be a commercial success. But again this was just another project that never become a trend or widely used. Basically this device was a canvas-instalaton for real time motion painting with your bare hands. </p>

<p>The instrument produced imagery by pressing against a rubberized screen so it could laminate into a narrow beam of colored light. The size of its screen was limited by the reach of the performer. Two people were required to operate the Lumigraph—one to manipulate the screen to create imagery, and a second to change the colors of the lights. <br />

<p>6. Abstract film and Video art</p>

<p>Abstract film can be described as sub-genre of experimental films. Most likely abstract film is used to visualize music during musical performance, but this term is used also concerning other disciplines of art. Some of the earliest motion graphics or abstract shapes were produced in Germany already in early 20's. By that time this genre was introduced as "Absolute Film". It was a category of films that was made to show different approaches and technics of abstractions in motion with out a particular narrative. They were made to create an emotional experience and new qualities of motion and rhythm in cinema and music. Those images were absolutely non-objective. As film historian William Moritz has noted that the history of abstract film is a culmination of trend that begin with Louis-Bertrand Castel’s<href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title="">[21]</a> attempt to create visual music in. Also this genre was strongly influenced by discovery of synesthesia. </p>

<p>Surprisingly, almost none of the early avant-garde films have been restored, and many of the further mentioned works are hardly available in common distribution.</p>

<p><i>The coloured rhythm is by no means an illustration or an interpretation of a musical piece. It is an autonomous art form, although based on the same psychological data as music… The basic element of my dynamic art is the coloured visual form, similar to the role of sound to music.</i></p>

<p><i>This element is determined by three factors:</i></p>

<p><i>1 – The specific (abstract) visual form,</i></p>

<p><i>2 – Rhythm, meaning the movement and transfiguration of this form,</i></p>

<p><i>3 – Colour. “(1)<href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><b>[22]</b></a></i></p>

<p><b>6.1 Walter Rutman</b></p>

<p>Walter Rutmann was not only a painter, graphic designer and animator, but also enthusiastic cellist and violinist. Ruttmann in 20's was a forerunner of post-World War II experimental films. He was born in Germany and for all his life he kept working for German Film industry. His first abstract short films were "Lichtspiel: Opus I" (1921) and "Opus II" (1923) (Photos 6.1.1 and 6.1.2). Those were the first widely acknowledged experiments of new abstract forms in early abstract film genre. Soon Rutman found a lot of associates that shared his passion for abstract explorations and music performance. Rutman was the center of new rising avant-garde art and music scene. Projections of his motion pieces during symphonic music concerts were considered to be very non-conventional and innovative by 20's in Germany. In addition, there’s a group of charming advertising films my by Ruttman, also there he prefers to use abstract animation as medium. However Ruttmann was actively involved making propaganda for Hitler. His work for the Third Reich raises a lot of questions, but even so he produced a lot of un-fascist series of films. Also his political believes can be blamed to be cause why popularity of his work stopped flourishing right after war. <br />
<br />
</p>

<p>With his ear for the narrative as well as the visual, Ruttmann works on a kind of audio-art. His formulations can also designate structure on the basis of musical points of departure such as pitch and rhythm.<href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title="">[23]</a></p>

<p>His first works on the field of abstract animation accompanied by music was a total abstraction, though it is really questionable that whether he was the first abstract animator. Already futurists and Russian avant-gardists challenged themselves with in this methodology before Opus I in 1921. His animations were crafted in the method of "tinting the film". This method was invented long before a color film was invented. "Ruttmann's craft" was to layer multiple color layers in order to assemble a psychedelic experience. His method of working was so complex that it would acquire handpick and collect hundreds and hundreds of layers in order to project a short film. <br />

<p>Knowledge of a graphic design and painting really became an advantage in his professional practice; he could make abstract art "to move" with his sense of color and space. Further on contemporary artists were inspired by the above-mentioned abstractions in motion, for example Andy Warhol's Exploding Plastic Inevitable in 1967 (Photo 6.1.3). </p>

<b>6.2 Hans Richter</b></p>

<p>Also Hans Richter is one of the first pioneers of abstract films. Particularly movie Rytmus 21 (Photo 6.2.1) that lasts only 3 minutes was a significant happening of a film production in early 20's. By this time the film industry in Germany and all world played a major economical and cultural role. <br />
<br />
Rytmus 21 was more of a meditative piece with only figurative representations. By that time it was something brand-new to show natural movements and kinetics by representations of geometric shapes. Those representations could be flowers, people or birds, but in fact they were just simulation of pure geometry of circles, lines and squares. Similarly as Ruttmann, Richter is using black background of animation, the purpose of it is really practical - in this way separated elements that are projected on canvas would blaze leaving background dark. This way animation would stay floating in the “air”. </p>

<p>He also explored new auditory metaphors and aesthetics of synesthesia: representing one sound with representational schemes of sight. His explorations were ground breaking in early film industry and music theory. His works represents how visual phenomena overlap concepts traditionally applied to music—rhythm, duration, and tone. </p>

<p>Latter on Richter started approaching animation and music visualizing in less abstract way. Elements that he used in animations were more representational and figurative. Also randomness of narrative was replaced by actual script with narrative. But in this early point in his career, he was fiercely excited by the "new medium" and radical abstraction. He has been a big inspiration for others to experiment with graphical rhythms and representations in the music.<br />

<p><i>The film is a play of relationships of light.</i></p>

<p><i>The relationships of light have both qualitative and quantitative character: degree of brightness, proportions, etc., etc.</i></p>

<p><i>The forms that emerge are, de facto, l i m i t s of processes in different dimensions (or of dimensions in a different temporal sequence). . . .</i></p>

<p><i>The true means of construction is light—the intensity and quantity of light.</i></p>

<p><i>The task for the whole is to shape the nature of the light—in the sense of a comprehensive perceptibility. . . .</i></p>

<p><i>The forms that emerge are n e i t h e r analogies nor symbols nor means to beauty.</i></p>

<p><i>In its sequence of events (its screening), this film communicates very authentically the relationships of tension and contrast in the light. These relationships consist of light and dark, small and large, slow and fast, horizontal and vertical, etc., etc.</i></p>

<p><i>An attempt has been made to organize the film such that the individual parts stand in active tension to one another and to the whole, such that the whole remains intellectually [geistig] mobile within itself. <href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><b>[24]</b></a></i></p>

<p><b>6.3 Viking Eggeling</b></p>

<p>Eggeling was one of the most influential and dedicated fiends and companions of Richter. Richter even credited his beloved friend for an idea of exploring the possibilities of abstract animation in his work. At the first glance their work seems to be really similar, but Viking had an extraordinary preference for working only with lines and curves. He seems to simplify idea of representations even more then Richter. He would draw, un-draw, redraw and erase his lines during the animation process. He believed that lines, stripes and curves say much more than any language or sound. His main goal was to rebuilt men’s vision into a spiritual language and perception. He wanted to illustrate the most complex emotions and thoughts with the most simplistic form of geometry. </p>

<p>During the years 1915 to 1917 Eggeling had started to work with the picture scrolls of "Horizontal — Vertical Orchestra" and "Diagonal Symphony" (Photo 6.3.1 and 6.3.2). Richter accompanies him and later recalls: "In these scrolls we tried to build difference phases of transformations as if they were phrases of a symphony of fugue". <href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title="">[25]</a></p>

<p>“Horisontal - Vertikal Orkester” is lost and was never shown in public. The film “Symphonie Diagonale” (“Diagonal symphony”) was made with a simple cutout technique where he used shapes of tin foil, filmed frame by frame. Several different copies of “Symphonie Diagonale” are still existent. He also was one of the first artists to introduce visual polyphony. He concentrated his imagery movement in way that it would not only compliment one aspect of music but it would have various pictorial themes and motifs at the same time. Eggeling was more interested in language of graphic elements rather then imaginative abstractions of world depicted. Till the end of his professional career he strongly believed that lines ar the most pure way of visualizing music and continuity of spirituality. </p>
